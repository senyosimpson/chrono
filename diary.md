# Diary

> The diary details interesting parts of building this asynchronous runtime.

This code is taken from another crate of mine, [`woi`](https://github.com/senyosimpson/woi) which is
a single-threaded runtime built for Linux. It contains a [diary](https://github.com/senyosimpson/woi/blob/main/diary.md)
journaling its development. It's a good place to start reading. This diary will continue from there.
